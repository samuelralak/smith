# Context, Session History, and Resume

Use `Smith::Context` when you want:

- persisted workflow context keys
- observation masking over session history
- injected state summaries

Example:

```ruby
class ReviewContext < Smith::Context
  persist :ticket_id, :current_findings, :source_urls

  session_strategy :observation_masking, window: 6

  inject_state do |persisted|
    <<~TEXT
      Ticket: #{persisted[:ticket_id]}
      Findings: #{persisted[:current_findings]}
      Sources: #{Array(persisted[:source_urls]).join(", ")}
    TEXT
  end
end

class ReviewWorkflow < Smith::Workflow
  context_manager ReviewContext
  initial_state :idle
  state :done

  transition :review, from: :idle, to: :done do
    execute :review_agent
  end
end
```

What Smith does for you:

- prepares masked session input at step boundaries
- injects a state summary message into that prepared input
- persists declared workflow context keys
- persists accepted session history
- preserves chosen next transitions across persistence
- supports JSON host round-trips through `to_state` and `.from_state`

Example host-controlled persistence:

```ruby
workflow = ReviewWorkflow.new(context: {
  ticket_id: "T-1042",
  current_findings: "needs escalation",
  source_urls: ["https://example.test/refund-policy"]
})

payload = JSON.generate(workflow.to_state)

# Store payload wherever your app wants.

restored = ReviewWorkflow.from_state(JSON.parse(payload))
result = restored.run!
```

Important: Smith is resumable, but it is still your app's job to store and retrieve that state.

For the common restore-or-initialize case, Smith also exposes a small configured-adapter one-liner:

```ruby
result = ReviewWorkflow.run_persisted!(
  key: "ticket:T-1042",
  context: {
    ticket_id: "T-1042",
    current_findings: "needs escalation"
  },
  on_step: ->(step) { puts "checkpointed #{step[:transition]}" },
  clear: :done
)
```

`clear: :done` is the default. Pass `clear: false` to preserve terminal state for host-managed cleanup timing, or `clear: :terminal` to clear any terminal workflow state once the run completes.

`on_step:` is a best-effort host callback. It runs after an accepted step has been checkpointed. Callback failures are logged and ignored; they do not roll back or abort durable workflow progression.

If the persistence key is a deterministic function of workflow context, declare it once on the workflow:

```ruby
class ReviewWorkflow < Smith::Workflow
  persistence_key { |ctx| "ticket:#{ctx[:ticket_id]}" }
end

result = ReviewWorkflow.run_persisted!(
  context: {
    ticket_id: "T-1042",
    current_findings: "needs escalation"
  }
)
```

When a workflow derives its key this way, Smith persists the resolved durability key in workflow state. That keeps instance-level helpers such as `persist!`, `advance_persisted!`, and `clear_persisted!` stable across restore even when the workflow's context manager persists only a filtered subset of context keys.

If you need more explicit control, the lower-level lifecycle is still available:

```ruby
workflow = ReviewWorkflow.restore_or_initialize(
  key: "ticket:T-1042",
  context: {
    ticket_id: "T-1042",
    current_findings: "needs escalation"
  }
)

step = workflow.advance_persisted!("ticket:T-1042")
# Host app can broadcast or project progress here.
emit_progress(step)

result = workflow.run_persisted!("ticket:T-1042")
workflow.clear_persisted!("ticket:T-1042")
```

`restore(key, ...)` is intentionally stricter: it requires a non-blank explicit key, and the lookup key remains authoritative for the restored workflow even if stored state contains an embedded `persistence_key`.

These helpers do not make Smith a job system or durable runtime. They only remove repetitive restore/checkpoint boilerplate around the configured persistence adapter while leaving queueing, projection, and recovery policy with the host app.

## Artifacts

Use artifacts when outputs are too large to keep inline.

Smith exposes:

- `Smith.artifacts.store`
- `Smith.artifacts.fetch`
- `Smith.artifacts.expired`

The common pattern is to hand off the heavy payload in `after_completion`.

```ruby
class LargeReportAgent < Smith::Agent
  register_as :large_report_agent
  model "gpt-4.1-nano"
  data_volume :unbounded

  def after_completion(result, _context)
    ref = Smith.artifacts.store(
      result[:full_report],
      content_type: "application/json"
    )

    {
      report_ref: ref,
      summary: result[:summary]
    }
  end
end
```

Configure a backend:

```ruby
Smith.configure do |config|
  config.artifact_store = Smith::Artifacts::Memory.new
  config.artifact_retention = 3600
end
```

Why this matters:

- large payloads can move out of the inline workflow result
- refs are execution-scoped
- nested workflows inherit artifact scope correctly
